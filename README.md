# Cerner powerplan primaries
This script uses a Cerner CCL-generated output (CSV or Excel file) that has powerplan information and their associated pharmacy synonyms (with associated primaries) to determine what combination of powerplans will encompass all unique primaries

The script is used to generate an output Excel file that gives the powerplan names to test and which primaries they will be testing
